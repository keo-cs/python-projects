## URL Converter

> Please go to the URL provided here: <https://bill-gates-blog.com/path/more_path>. No wait... that was supposed to be <https://bill-gates-blog2.com/path/more_path>. If only there was a way to easily change links to the new domain instead of manually modifying them every time.

Create a script that takes a URL for the old domain as an input and returns a URL using the new domain. This script should include input validation ensuring that the input is actually a URL and the URL is for the old domain.

**Bonus:** Instead of returning the new URL, the script should open up my browser and navigate to the new URL.
