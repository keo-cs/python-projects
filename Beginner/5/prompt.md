## Rock Paper Scissors

Create a Script that allows you to play the classic game of rock paper scissors. This script should be played through the command line and allow you to play against a computer against another player.

Requirements:

* The win conditions for each match are as follows:
  * Rock beats scissors
  * Scissors beats paper
  * Paper beats rock
* The script should get the user's choice to play against the computer or against another player.
* If both choices are the same, it is a tie.
* The script should display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.
* If the user chooses to play against another player, the script should ask for the name of each player and get their choices separately. The script should not reveal the choices until both players have entered their choices. The script should display the name of each player, their choice, and the result of the game.
