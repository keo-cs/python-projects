# Python Intermediate Project #2

## VirusTotal Client + GUI

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the VirusTotal client that you developed in project #1. The GUI should allow the user to enter a file hash and get the scan results from VirusTotal in a user-friendly format. The GUI should also display some statistics and visualizations of the scan results, such as the number and percentage of positive detections, and the names and categories of the detected threats. The GUI
should be implemented using the Python framework `Tkinter`.

**Bonus:** Create a pie chart showing the distribution of detection ratings.
